				<p>Relations between the Soviet Union and the United States were driven by a complex interplay of ideological, political, and economic factors, which led to shifts between cautious cooperation and often bitter superpower rivalry over the years.</p>

				<h3>The Cold War</h3>
				<p>Space exploration served as another dramatic arena for Cold War competition. On October 4, 1957, a Soviet R-7 intercontinental ballistic missile launched Sputnik (Russian for “traveler”), the world's first artificial satellite and the first man-made object to be placed into the Earth's orbit.</p>

				<h3>Did you know?</h3>
				<p>
					By the mid-1950s, the U.S.-Soviet Cold War had worked its way into the fabric of everyday life in both countries, fueled by the arms race and the growing threat of nuclear weapons, wide-ranging espionage and counter-espionage between the two countries, war in Korea and a clash of words and ideas carried out in the media.

				<h3>Is the space race still prevalent in society today?</h3>
				<p>
					Definitely, the Space Race has left a remarkable legacy in the field of space research worldwide.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the pioneers of space missions, both the United States and USSR helped their allies build their space missions through the training of scientists and engineers, the transferring of technology, and by allowing other researchers to visit their space laboratories. That way, both superpowers could learn and improve their knowledge and skills related to space research.

				<h3>What were the impacts of the space race?</h3>
				<p>
					The Space Race was considered important because it advanced countries to introduce new science, technology, and economic systems.

				<h3>Quote</h3>
				<p>
					“As fantastical as America’s space ambitions might have seemed, sending a man into space was starting to feel like a straightforward task compared to putting black and white students together in the same Virginia classrooms.” ― Margot Lee Shetterly
